-alright, so we copied most everything over from the public html page; we have the Procfile, the package.json, etc.
-we've also set the server to basically just run the home route (app.use("/")) which renders index, and hopfeully that finds index.html
and not index.js lol, bc that code is inside index.js
-one thing that might cause the app to not work, is that they are using "app.use(express.static(_dirname + "/public"))" and we haven'that
created that yet, mainly because we're unsure of our directory
-ok, so we go to log in to heroku so we can test the local host site, but it ways invalid credentials, so we google it and then try to 
log in from the browser, but this says IP address mismatch lol, let's try logging into the CiscoAnytime connect and see if that changes
anything. Lol, I think it turns out we are using the wrong password. It's actually our school password, and its the new school password,
so annoying
-so, we type in "heroku local web" and we get this error "[WARN] Required Key 'web' Does Not Exist in Procfile Definition", which we've
never even seen before. So apparently the "web" part of heroku local web actually means something, and is different from the "worker"
that we have in our Procfile, so that's why it doesn't work. When we just type "heroku local", we don't get that error, but now it says
we don't have axios, so we have to "npm i axios" to install it. Let's add the gitignore since that downloaded the node modules
-interesting, so now we are getting the address in use error, which I think we've gotten before but the website still worked when we
deployed it, let's look at the previous notes and see what it says. Yeah, rereading our notes from last time, we did get this address in
use, but when we deployed it, it worked, so, let's try to deploy it I guess
